# flex-layot-practice

Introduction
Welcome to my first project using Flexbox to create a responsive web page. In this project, I used Flexbox to build a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

Technologies Used
To create this project, I used HTML, CSS, and Flexbox. I also used Visual Studio Code, to write and edit the code.

Project Description
The goal of this project was to create a responsive web page that displays different elements in a flexible layout. The page includes a header, a main section, and a bottom section. The header contains a logo and a navigation menu, while the main section includes multiple content sections that are arranged in a grid using Flexbox.
